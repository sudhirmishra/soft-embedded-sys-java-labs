# Lab 1 #

1. Give code for `Rectangle` class	
	* It should have 4 fields of int type for `x`, `y`, `width` and `height`	
	* It should have 3 constructors:
		* Four argument constructor which sets all field values. 
		* No argument constructor which sets all field values to 0. This will call the 4 argument constructor 
		* Make a three argument constructor which sets width = height. This will also call the 4 argument constructor 	
	* Make methods for Rectangle class
		* Give code for a methods `getWidth()`, `getHeight()`, `setWidth()` and `setHeight()` which should return/set the corresponding field values
		* Give code for the `Translate (a,b`) method to move a Rectangle to (x+a, y+b)
	* Give code for `UseRectangle` class
		* It should have 3 objects of type Rectangle created by the three constructors.
		* Set the parameters for the no-argument Rectangle.


2. Give code for `Circle` class	
	* It should have 3 fields of int type for `x`, `y` and `radius`
	* It should have a class level field for the value of `PI=3.14`
	* It should have 3 constructors:
		* Three argument constructor which sets all field values. 
		* No argument constructor which sets all field values to 0. This will call the 3 argument constructor 
		* Make a two argument constructor which sets x and y and radius= 0. This will also call the 3 argument constructor 
	* Methods for `Circle` class
		*	Give code for a methods `getX()`, `setX()`, `setRadius()` and set setRadius () .. which should return/set the corresponding field values
		* Give code for the `translate (a,b)` method to move circle to (x+a, y+b)
		* Give code for the `area()` method which will return the area. Use the PI value as defined at the class level.
	* Give code for `UseCircle` class
		* It should have 3 objects of type `Circle` created by the three constructors.
		* Set the parameters for the no-argument Circle.
		* Output the area of the three Circles.
